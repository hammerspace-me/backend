    Backend service for Metaverse Backpack - a virtual backpack for your Metaverse assets

## About The Project

The backpack backend is a service that creates a virtual backpack for your assets stored on IPFS and makes them available for third-party applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- npm

  Install npm as the service is based on NodeJS and uses npm as a package manager.
  _NOTE:_ This installation command requires [brew](https://brew.sh/) and only runs on Mac.

  ```sh
  $ brew install node
  ```

- Docker

  Install docker as the service requires a database for persistent storage.
  _NOTE:_ This installation command requires [brew](https://brew.sh/) and only runs on Mac.

  ```sh
  brew cask install docker
  ```

- Environment

  Rename the environment file and add your credentials. Environment file is read by NestJS and Docker.

  ```sh
  mv .env.example .env
  ```

- Web3.Storage account and API token

  In order to use web3.storage you need an API key. First, head over to [web3.storage](https://web3.storage) to login with your email address. You will receive an email with a magic link that signs you in – no password needed. After you successfully logged in, go to API Keys via the account section of the navigation bar. You will find a button to Create a new token. When prompted for an API key name, you can freely choose one or use “Backpack”. Copy the content of the key column to your .env file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Metaverse-Backpack/backpack-backend.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

The backpack backend consists of two components: the backend service and the database. First start the database with the following command:

```bash
# Start up the development database
$ npm run start:db
```

When the database is running, start the backend service with the following command:

```bash
# Start service in watch mode (automatically reload if files change)
$ npm run start:dev
```

There are further commands that can be used to start the backend service, e.g., for development mode without watching file changes and production mode:

```bash
# Build service in development mode and run (does not automatically reload)
$ npm run start

# Build service in production mode and run
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Known Issues

- Backend service fails to start when changes are made to the database model: Currently there is no proper database migration management implemented. Whenever the database entities are changed, there is the possibility of a crash of the backend service as the database model differs from the database itself. To resolve the issue, the database can be removed and re-deployed, either by removing the old container and starting a new one (`docker-compose stop db`, `docker-compose rm db`, `docker-compose up -d db`) or by using a tool/CLI to interact with the database and purge it completely.
